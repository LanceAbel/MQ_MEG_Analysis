Running experiment
Once-off:

	Put sound .wavs in: 		D:\BHPC_Files\ME_199_Lance\New Experiment\Sounds
	Put tone frequency list in:	D:\BHPC_Files\ME_199_Lance\New Experiment\Tone Inputs\
	Define conditions:		D:\BHPC_Files\ME_199_Lance\New Experiment\exp_conditions.txt
					Row = [a b c]
	    					a = child (or adult) number      (a counts up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for BOTH children < 18 and adults)
										 i.e. the count goes up separately for each
						b = number of 2ND experiment to run
								Options were
									1: skewed reps uniform tones lowvol
									2: skewed reps uniform tones high vol
									3: uniform reps uniform tones low vol
									5: skewed reps skewed tones low vol
							
						c = number of 3RD experiment to run

Each time:
	Open mixer:	D:\BHPC_Files\ME_199_Lance\New Experiment\Mixer\roving_MMR Lance.tmws


	Define oddball_short_master.m -> sub = '900x', inits (initials) = 'LA' (e.g.), par_num = 1 for 9002 then count up separately for adults/kids 
		Then run - selecting 1 for 'run' input (1st session for adults + children: 15 mins)
			Then abort, and play sounds for 30 secs
			Then new marker coil measurement
		
		Then run - selecting 2 for 'run' input (2nd session for adults: 10 mins)
			Then abort, and play sounds for 30 secs
			Then new marker coil measurement
		Then run - selecting 3 for 'run' input (2nd session for adults: 10 mins)
			Then abort, and play sounds for 30 secs
			Then new marker coil measurement
